# Sammanslaget
A small presentation site for the "Sammanslaget" project as produced by "Grupp 9"

The "Sammaslaget" project is a cooperative recurring event at YRGO. It is sort of a kickoff for classes returning from the summer vacation. Its subject varies, and in this case the project on our end involved three different courses, namely User Experience (UX), Game Programming (GP) and us Web-devs (WU). The task was to think up new concept for selection tests to YRGO's different courses, and then present the idea and a prototype on a website.

## The process
We started out focusing on the WU selection test, but during a brain storming session we realised that our idea was open enough to be applied to other courses' tests as well, so we went from a specifc to a more general approach. The remaing part of the process saw the pupil from UX produce clear and accessible information texts about the concept, the pupil from GP producing an interactive prototype using the Unity engine, and us from WU creating and deploying a site to host the concept.
